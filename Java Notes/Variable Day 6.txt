Variables :
============


            * Variable is like a container to store the data values.

            * Variable is nothing but another name of reference name.

            * Variable name is like a short name like(a, b, c) or descriptive name (age, name, value)

            * Variable name is starts with letter eg: (a1 )

            * Variable name cannot starts with number eg: (1a)  number_1, num$, (invalid --> num@1)

            * Variable Declaration :

			DataType variableName = VariableValue;

             eg :
 	                int a = 17;
                                 


Types :
-----------

1. Class Variable or Instance Variable or Global variable
2. Local Variable.



1. Class Variable or Instance variable :

		*class Variable present in must be outside the method and inside the class .
		
		*It's lifecycle will be through out the class.

		*No need to initialize the class variable.  int a = 2;  int b;
		
		*If we not initialize the value to the variable, the default value of the given datatype which                  will be printed.



2. Local Variable :
	  	
		*Local variable must be inside the method.
		
		*It's lifecycle will be through out the method.

		*we must initialize the local variable.

                *If we give local and class variable as a same reference name the priority go to local                           variable.
