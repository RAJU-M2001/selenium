Type Casting:
=============

Convert a value from one datatype to another datatype is known as type casting.


Types
======
1. Widening Type casting
2. Narrowing Type casting



1. Widening Type Casting:
========================

* Converting a lower data type into a higher data type.

* It is also known as implicit conversion.

* It is done automatically.

* It is safe and there is no chance to lose data.


Eg:-

byte-> short-> int-> long

2. Narrowing Type Casting:
========================

* Converting a Higher data type into a lower data type.

* It is also known as explicit conversion.

* It is done by manually by the programmer.

* If we do not perform casting then the compiler reports a compile time error.


Syntax:-

Datatype ref.name = (Datatype) variable name;  


double -> float -> long -> int


  -126  -127  -128    0   1  2 3 .......... 127, 128, 129



Upcasting :
===========

Assigning child class object into parent class.

It is possible in java


Down Casting:
==============

Assigning parent class object into child class.

It is not possible in java
