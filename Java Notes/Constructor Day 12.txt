Constructor :
=============

* A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type.

* When we create an object for the class, the default constructor will be executed automatically 
at the time itself.

* Class Name And Constructor name will be same.

* It is also pascal format.

* It supports method overloading, but it doesn't supports method overriding.

* If class name are different we can't create constructor.

* There is no return type for constructor (void).



Types :

1. Default Constructor (or) non - parameterized Constructor

2. Parameterized Constructor 



Constructor Chaining:-
====================

Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
